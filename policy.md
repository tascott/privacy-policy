Last updated: July 15, 2025

1. Introduction
Bonnie’s Mobile (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).

2. Information We Collect
2.1. Personal Information You Provide

Authentication: When you create an account, we collect your email address and a password.

Profile Data: Your name, phone number, and any avatar or profile picture you choose to upload.

2.2. Device and Usage Data

Location Data:

While In Use: We collect precise GPS location to show your position on the map and calculate routes.

Always (Background): If you enable background tracking (for geofencing/pickup notifications), we collect your location even when the App is not in the foreground.

Camera & Photos:

We request camera access to let you take or attach photos (e.g. of a dog or pickup location).

We request media-library access to let you choose existing photos.

Crash & Usage Analytics:

We collect anonymous crash reports and usage logs via Sentry to improve App stability.

We may collect aggregated analytics (screen views, button taps) via Google Analytics / Firebase.

3. How We Use Your Information

Core Functionality: To display maps, calculate routes, and notify you when you approach a pickup point.

Authentication & Security: To verify your identity, enable Face ID / biometric login, and prevent unauthorized access.

Notifications: To send you local notifications when you’re near a scheduled pickup.

Customer Support: To investigate issues and respond to your support requests.

Improvements & Bug Fixes: To analyze crashes, performance issues, and feature usage patterns.

4. Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell or rent your personal information. We may share your data with:

Service Providers: Supabase (backend), Google Maps (routing), Stripe (payments), Sentry (crash logging), Firebase (analytics).

Legal Requirements: If required by law or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities.

5. Data Retention
We retain your account and profile data as long as you use the App. You can delete your account at any time via the App’s settings; we will then remove your personal information within 30 days, except for anonymized logs.

6. Your Choices

Location Permissions: You can grant or revoke “While Using the App” and “Always” location permissions in your device settings.

Camera & Photo Permissions: You can revoke camera or media-library access at any time.

Notifications: You can disable push or local notifications in your device’s notification settings.

Opt-Out of Analytics: To opt out of analytics or crash reporting, disable “Share Diagnostics” in the App’s Settings.

7. Security
We use industry-standard measures (HTTPS/TLS, data encryption at rest, secure authentication) to protect your data. However, no method is 100% secure.

8. Children’s Privacy
Our App is not intended for children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 16.

9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you via the App or by email when significant changes occur, and we will update the “Last updated” date above.
